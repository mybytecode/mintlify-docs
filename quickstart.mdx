### Step 2: Deploy Your MCP Server
Choose one of the following ways to deploy:

**🔍 Option 1: Use a Curated Server**

Navigate to the MCP Directory.
Browse verified servers contributed by the verified developers and organizations.
Click Deploy on any server to set it up instantly.

**🔗 Option 2: Bring Your Own Server**

Go to Directory > Add Server > via GitHub. [Deploy via Github](https://platform.contexaai.com/mcp-directory/github)
Enter public GitHub repo URL containing your MCP code.
Configure deployment settings and click Deploy.

**📄 Option 3: Create from OpenAPI Spec**

Navigate to Directory > Add Server > via OpenAPI. [Deploy via OpenAPI](https://platform.contexaai.com/mcp-directory/open-api)
Upload your OpenAPI 3.0 spec file or paste the spec in the editor.
Name your server and click Deploy.

### Step 3: Test in Playground

Once your MCP server is deployed:
Go to the Playground section.
Select your MCP server from the list.
Choose an LLM model (e.g., GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-4o-mini, etc.).
Send requests and view live responses from your MCP server.
You can compare results across different models to evaluate behavior and performance.

### Step 4: View Logs and Analytics (Coming Soon)

Head to Observability > Logs & Analytics.
Use filters to monitor real-time usage, performance, and errors.
Our open-source client library lets you easily integrate logging into your MCP server code.

### Step 5: Set up Access Control (Coming Soon)

Head to Access Control > Teams & Policies.
Define access policies at the team or individual level.
Control visibility and usage of MCP servers and tools across departments or clients.

### You’re All Set!
You’ve now:
- Signed in
- Deployed your first MCP server
- Tested it with real models
- Viewed logs and metrics (Coming Soon)
- (Optionally) Set up access control (Coming Soon)
